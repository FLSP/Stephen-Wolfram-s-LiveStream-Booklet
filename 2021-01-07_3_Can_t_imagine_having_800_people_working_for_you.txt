Q: Can't imagine having 800 people working for you

It is much easier for me to run something than to be part of a whole that is run by consensus. I much prefer to make my own mistakes, take responsibility for things, and I am not afraid to do that. That is a much easier calculation for me than to follow someone else's direction and navigate a consensus to figure out what to do. I think it depends on personality. For some people, being in charge and realizing they could make a mistake that could lead to disaster is much more stressful. For me, it is less stressful than trying to manipulate a group of people to agree with what I am trying to do or convincing my boss to agree. It is more stressful for me to navigate those dynamics than to make a decision, do my best, and figure out the next steps if something goes wrong.
In terms of company sizes, one thing to realize is that above a few hundred people, some aspects of running a company become scale-invariant. I deal with about 50 to 100 people on a routine basis at our company, and others are in groups managed by those people. I do not interact with them directly unless for specific purposes. Even with 5,000 employees, the company would still feel like one with 50 to 100 people in terms of direct personal interaction because that is the interface I have with the organization. More can get done with more people, but it is not directly visible at a human level to the CEO.
At different scales, different things happen. For example, with 20 people in a company, there are many single points of failure and personal dependencies. By the time you reach a few hundred people, there are still important individuals, but their departure would not be a disaster for the company. Above a few hundred people, the number of single points of failure decreases, which has consequences for the CEO's role. As the company grows larger, managing the direction becomes more challenging, especially when trying to change course after years of moving in one direction.
In our company, much of this depends on company culture and whether people expect change. In the early years, we introduced Mathematica in 1988, which was very successful. In the 1990s, I spent time on basic science and my book, *A New Kind of Science*. I did this because, in the early years, I was constantly generating to-do lists, but the company could not absorb them. It was either frustrating for me or risking the company flying apart from excessive energy. I decided to reduce my day-to-day involvement, which lasted longer than expectedâ€”ten and a half years instead of 18 months. When I returned to intense management, the company felt more grown-up, and I could do new things.
However, the company identified as the maker of Mathematica, and there was resistance to doing something new. When I started Wolfram Alpha around 2004-2005, I did it as a special project with a group that worked on unconventional projects. This group grew to about 200 people, somewhat invisible to the rest of the company. It was difficult to start a new project in a company successful in one direction. Once it became clear the project was sensible, my management team supported it, but it required forcefulness to get it off the ground. Being a geo-distributed company made it easier to manage such a project without drawing too much attention.
There is a question from Icy: When did I start to have an entrepreneurial spirit?
