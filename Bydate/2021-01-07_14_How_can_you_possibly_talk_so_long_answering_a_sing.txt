Q: How can you possibly talk so long answering a single question?

A lot of really interesting questions here. This is great. I look forward to continuing this. I will answer one more question here and then wrap up for now.
In terms of our live stream podcasting adventures, I am planning three series. One is my Science and Technology Q&A for kids and others, which is on Fridays, coming up tomorrow this week. On a different day, probably at this time, we will be alternating in successive weeks between this Business and Innovation Q&A and a History of Science and Technology Q&A, which has also been requested. I will talk about some history I have been involved in and history that I have studied.
There was a question here from EE. How has having our company based in Illinois near the University of Illinois, instead of Silicon Valley, New York City, or Boston, impacted the company? What convinced me to make this decision?
